I am currently a PhD student at [Scene Grammar Lab](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com) interested in scene perception and using supervised and unsupervised deep-learning models to explore how scene-grammar might capture relevant factors of variation in natural images and how higher-level semantic networks support a variety of visual-cognitive tasks. In the summer of 2019, I did a three month internship in [Talia Konkle's Lab](https://konklab.fas.harvard.edu), at Harvard, where I got first hands on experience in the area of deep-learning. During my master's, I took computer science courses on machine learning and computer vision to deepen my knowledge in these areas. I love learning new methods and diving into different kinds of analyses. I also really enjoy tutoring Goethe-University bachelor and master students for their research internships and each year's [EXPRA](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com/teaching/expra/). If you're interested in working on a project with me feel free to get in contact!
